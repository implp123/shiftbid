**Leave 1 Captain spot available until you know Kirk and Rice will be able to pick!!*
*As of right now, you have to treat the app like it's a live draft.
Meaning if you put a name back into the pool, it's gonna screw with
the counts, so try to stick to the shift requirement listed under the names prior to
putting a name to a shift.
*The training division is locked in so once a person is placed there, you'll have to 
refresh the whole thing to move them around. 
*It's not perfect, but it's a cool start. 
**Keep in mind that one Captain & Captain-Medic spot need to be open for an Acting Battalion, meaning
don't slam 5 captains on a shift if none of them are Act. Batt.'s **
